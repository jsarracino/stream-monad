Simple, Fair and Terminating Backtracking Monad
===============================================

This Haskell library provides an implementation of the MonadPlus type
class that enumerates results of a non-deterministic computation by
interleaving subcomputations in a way that has usually much better
memory performance than other strategies with the same termination
properties.
